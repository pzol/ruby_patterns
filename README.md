Ruby Patterns
=============

Those are application patterns recommended and frequently used by me in my apps. The aim is not to provide the standard GOF patterns, but real life snippets for scenarios I came across frequently. 

Some of the examples, might not be the simplest to follow, this might be due the fact, that I was trying to make them no the typical over-simplified blog examples, but close to real life situations.

All examples can be found in the specs.

## General Guidelines

### Units of Work
 * small units of work
